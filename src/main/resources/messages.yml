# PLACEHOLDERS
# In this config file you can use both the normal and PlaceholderAPI variants of Cosmic Mining's placeholders.
# However, if any of them are required ELSEWHERE, you MUST use PlaceholderAPI's variant.
# This can be accomplished by adding "cosmic_" before the required placeholder.
#
# For example:
# if you'd want to include a player's current mining level on a scoreboard
# you would have to use "%cosmic_player_level%" instead of "%player_level%".

armor-level-too-low: "&cYou cannot equip this armor because your mining level is too low!"
pickaxe-level-too-low: "&cYou cannot use this pickaxe because your mining level is too low!"
